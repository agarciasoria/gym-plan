Laura's Beginner Gym Plan - Static Site
----------------------------------------
This folder is a ready-to-upload static site for GitHub Pages.

- index.html
- exercises/ (individual exercise pages)
- progress/progress.html (uses localStorage to save workouts)
- assets/styles.css

How to use:
1. Open index.html in a browser to preview locally.
2. To host: create a GitHub repo and push this folder. Enable GitHub Pages in settings for the repo (use main branch, / (root)).
3. The site will be available at https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/

Notes:
- Videos are embedded from YouTube; replace URLs as desired.
- Progress tracking uses localStorage (saved locally on the device/browser).
